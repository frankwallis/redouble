					<h3>About this application</h3>
					<p>
						The application you are using is an isomorphic application, written in ES6 using ReactJS and the Flux architecture via Redux.
						It is built using WebPack, React-Hot-Loader and Babel, runs on NodeJS and is and hosted on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/frankwallis/redouble">here</a>.<br/>
						The card-play logic is handled by a C/C++ library called <a href="https://github.com/dds-bridge/dds">DDS</a> via a custom written <a href="https://github.com/frankwallis/dds-node-adapter">adapter</a> which
						uses the NodeJS native API.<br/>
						The application has also been ported to <a href="https://github.com/frankwallis/redouble/tree/angular2">Angular2</a>.<br/>
						It is a work-in-progress, so please excuse any strange behaviours, or send a <a href="https://github.com/frankwallis/redouble/">pull request</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						Special thanks to the good people at BrowserStack for providing cross-browser integration test support.
